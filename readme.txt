== Description ==

The WordPress PayPal Donations Plugin allows you to create a donations page or post where your readers can donate any amount they wish. You have a series of options including:

* Specify the number of donations and/or links to show
* Specify an expiry date whereby donations older than this date will not be shown
* Offer the ability to supply a link back to their own site if the user donates more than a specified amount.

WordPress PayPal Donations Plugin uses IPN to ensure the values are correct and you can also chose to display your total donations to date.
